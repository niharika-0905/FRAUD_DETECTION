FRAUD_DETECTION

Online Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Hey! This is a machine learning project where I trained a Random Forest classifier to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model learns from real or synthetic data and helps classify whether a transaction is fraud or not fraud.


=> What’s In?

ML.py – Main code that:

Loads the dataset (creditcard.csv)

Splits it into train & test sets

Trains a Random Forest model

Evaluates the model with a classification report and a confusion matrix

synthetic_creditcard.py – Creates a synthetic dataset with realistic transaction features if you don’t have real data

creditcard.csv – Dataset used (either real or generated)


=> Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook or Command Line


=> Note: Fraud cases are rare in real datasets. The synthetic data generator balances this to give you ~3% fraud cases.

If you’re using real data, make sure it's handled responsibly and ethically.
